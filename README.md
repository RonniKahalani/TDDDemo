## Selenium Web UI Testing
This code also contains a few Selenium UI test sample.

NOTE:

You need to download the Selenium WebDriver, you want to test with (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge...). [You find the downloads here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

Remember to make the WebDriver folder available in your Windows Path system variable, so Selenium can call it.

Sample (ChromeDriver)
