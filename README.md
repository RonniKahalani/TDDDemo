# TDDDemo
## The step by step tutorial.
This is a small TDD sample, building a headless calculator taking numbers via a number source interface, which is mocked via Mockito.

## Selenium Web UI Testing
This code also contains a few Selenium UI test sample.

NOTE:

You need to download the Selenium WebDriver, you want to test with (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge...). [You find the downloads here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).

Remember to make the WebDriver folder available in your Windows Path system variable, so Selenium can call it.

Setting WebDriver
> System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "<folder>/chromedriver.exe");
> System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "<folder>/geckodriver.exe");
> System.setProperty("webdriver.edge.driver",<folder>/msedgedriver.exe");
